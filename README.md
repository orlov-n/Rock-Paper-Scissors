## Overview

One of the lesser known facts is that you can play "rock, paper, scissors" game with poker hands.  Even though this concept exists I've never seen it turned into an app.  That's why I thought that my mod1 final project would be a perfect opportunity to bring this concept to life. 

This app gives user a very unique opportunity to play a poker-themed game of "rock, paper, scissors" against a computer.

## Where to Play?
The deployed site is available [here](https://orlov-n.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)

### Setup Instructions for running locally

1. Clone the repository to a local machine.
2. Go into the directory with the repository's files.
3. Open index.html.

## How to Play?

1. After the page loads the user will see two large buttons shaped like a poker table in the middle of the screen that represent two games: "Classic" and "Fancy" (with an added twist.) Each button contains the rules for the respective game. The user can then select which type of game they'd like to play.

2. After selecting the game the user will be presented with a choice of poker hands in the middle of the poker table. The hand that the user has selected will be displayed on the left side of the screen, while the bot's hand will be displayed on the right.  The rest of the cards will disapper from the middle of the table to signify that the round is in progress. The cards will reappear after about 2 seconds and the new round can start. The played hands will remain visible for reference until new cards have been selected.

3. The game is meant to be remenisent of an actual poker game.  Since poker is a zero-sum game the scores for players were designed to go up AND down depending on who won the round so the loser will have to settle the score with the winner.

<br />
This is a high stakes game so each round is worth $1000!

DO NOT PLAY WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE!

### Extensions
1. A "reset score" button has been added to zero out the scores without needing to reload the page and to leave the current game.

2. Different messages appear at the top of the screen to help the user follow the game and to make the experience more fun and enjoyable.

3.  The poker theme is consistent throughout and closely follows the poker lingo, style and tradition.
